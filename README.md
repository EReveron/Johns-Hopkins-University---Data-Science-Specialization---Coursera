This repository include examples of my work related with the **Data Science Specialization** from [**Johns Hopkins University**](http://www.jhu.edu) thought [**Coursera**](http://www.coursera.org). 

The [**Data Science Specialization**] (http://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) include nine (9) courses and a final Capstone Project. The courses are taught by professors [**Brian Caffo, PhD**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-peng-6b39a095), [**Jeff Leek, PhD**] (http://www.linkedin.com/in/jtleek), and [**Roger Peng, PhD**] (http://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-peng-6b39a095), of the [**Bloomberg School's Department of Biostatistics**] (http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2014/coursera-specialization.html). 

The program is entirely online; every class includes quizzes, projects and programming. **Each course is four weeks long**, and the final **Capstone Project is seven weeks long**.

I decided to start this Specialization as a **independent an personal goal** with the main objective of build the foundations to enroll in a formal Graduate Course (a Master Program) in the near future.

I **started** on **September 2015** and **finish the Capstone Project** on **July 2016**, this is the list of the courses and some examples of my work on it:




1. [**The Data Scientist's Toolbox**] (https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox): this course provide an introduction to the main tools and ideas in the data scientist's toolbox. The course gives an overview of the data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work with. There are two components to this course. The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable knowledge. The second is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like version control, markdown, git, GitHub, R, and RStudio.

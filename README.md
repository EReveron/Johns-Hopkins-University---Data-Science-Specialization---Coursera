# Johns Hopkins University - Data Science Specialization - Coursera

This repository include examples of my work related with the **Data Science Specialization** from **Johns Hopkins University** thought **Coursera**. :ve:

The [Data Science Specialization] (http://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) include nine (9) courses and a final Capstone Project. The courses are taught by professors [Brian Caffo, PhD](http://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-peng-6b39a095), [Jeff Leek, PhD] (http://www.linkedin.com/in/jtleek), and [Roger Peng, PhD] (http://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-peng-6b39a095), of the [Bloomberg School’s Department of Biostatistics] (http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2014/coursera-specialization.html). 

The program is entirely online; every class includes quizzes, projects and programming. Each course is eight weeks long, and the final Capstone Project is seven weeks long.

I decided to enroll in this Specialization as a **independent an personal goal** with the main objective of build the foundations to enroll in a formal Graduate Course (a Master Program) in the near future.

I **enroll** on **October 2015** and **finish the Capstone Project** on **July 2016**, this is the list of the courses and some examples of my work on it:

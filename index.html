<p>This repository include examples of my work related with the <strong>Data Science Specialization</strong> from <a href="http://www.jhu.edu"><strong>Johns Hopkins University</strong></a> thought <a href="http://www.coursera.org"><strong>Coursera</strong></a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science"><strong>Data Science Specialization</strong></a> include nine (9) courses and a final Capstone Project. The courses are taught by professors <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-peng-6b39a095"><strong>Brian Caffo, PhD</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jtleek"><strong>Jeff Leek, PhD</strong></a>, and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-peng-6b39a095"><strong>Roger Peng, PhD</strong></a>, of the <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2014/coursera-specialization.html"><strong>Bloomberg School's Department of Biostatistics</strong></a>. </p>

<p>The program is entirely online; every class includes quizzes, projects and programming. <strong>Each course is four weeks long</strong>, and the final <strong>Capstone Project is seven weeks long</strong>.</p>

<p>I decided to start this Specialization as a <strong>independent an personal goal</strong> with the main objective of build the foundations to enroll in a formal Graduate Course (a Master Program) in the near future.</p>

<p>I <strong>started</strong> on <strong>September 2015</strong> and <strong>finish the Capstone Project</strong> on <strong>July 2016</strong>, this is the list of the courses and some examples of my work on it:</p>

The course gives an overview of the data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work with. There are two components to this course. The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable knowledge. The second is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like version control, markdown, git, GitHub, R, and RStudio.</p>
